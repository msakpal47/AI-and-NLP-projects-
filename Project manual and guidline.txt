Object Detection using YOLOv3: User Manual and Guideline

Project Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) for object detection in images. It loads images from a specified folder, detects objects using the YOLOv3 model, and saves the output images with bounding boxes around detected objects.

System Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV 4.x
3. NumPy
4. YOLOv3 model files (yolov3.cfg, yolov3.weights, coco.names)

Setup and Configuration

1. Install required libraries: pip install opencv-python numpy
2. Download YOLOv3 model files from official repository
3. Update image_folder, output_folder, config_path, weights_path, and classes_path variables in the code to match your file locations

Running the Project

1. Execute the Python script
2. The script will iterate through all images in the specified image_folder
3. For each image, it will:
    - Load the image
    - Prepare input for YOLOv3 model
    - Run object detection
    - Draw bounding boxes around detected objects
    - Save output image to output_folder

Customization

1. Adjust conf_threshold (confidence threshold) and nms_threshold (non-maximum suppression threshold) values to fine-tune detection accuracy
2. Update classes_path to use a different class names file
3. Modify draw_prediction function to customize bounding box appearance

Output

1. Output images with bounding boxes around detected objects will be saved in output_folder
2. Console output will display processing status and output image paths

Troubleshooting

1. Ensure YOLOv3 model files are correctly downloaded and configured
2. Verify image folder and output folder paths are correct
3. Adjust confidence and NMS thresholds to improve detection accuracy

YOLOv3 Model Files

1. yolov3.cfg: YOLOv3 model configuration file
2. yolov3.weights: YOLOv3 model weights file
3. coco.names: Class names file for object detection

Code Explanation

The code consists of:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Setting up directory paths and loading YOLOv3 model files
3. Defining functions for loading output layers and drawing bounding boxes
4. Iterating through images, detecting objects, and saving output images

Functions

1. get_output_layers(net): Returns output layers of the YOLOv3 model
2. draw_prediction(img, class_id, confidence, x, y, x_plus_w, y_plus_h): Draws bounding box and label on the image

Variables

1. image_folder: Input image folder path
2. output_folder: Output image folder path
3. config_path: YOLOv3 configuration file path
4. weights_path: YOLOv3 weights file path
5. classes_path: Class names file path
6. conf_threshold: Confidence threshold for object detection
7. nms_threshold: Non-maximum suppression threshold

By following this user manual and guideline, users can successfully run the object detection project using YOLOv3.
